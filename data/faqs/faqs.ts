		After submitting a claim with a photo of the broken device displaying the IMEI/serial number and receiving repair approval, you will have a maximum of 30 days to get your device repaired and submit the repair receipt to avoid the closure of your one-time claim.
		<br><br>
		The repair receipt should include the following accurate details:
		<br><br>
		<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 2em;">
			<li>Repair store name and phone number</li>
			<li>Repair date</li>
			<li>IMEI (for smartphones) or serial number (for tablets and wearables)</li>
			<li>Device make and model</li>
			<li>Type of repair performed</li>
			<li>Amount paid</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		To submit the receipt, you have two convenient options:
		<br><br>
		<ol style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 2em;">
			<li>Upload a photo of the receipt using the instaProtek app</li>
			<li>Email the photo of the receipt to <a href="mailto:support@instaprotek.com" style="color: #039be5;">support@instaprotek.com</a></li>
		</ol>
		<br>
		Upon receiving the receipt, we will carefully validate it with the repair store. You will be promptly notified of the reimbursement status via email or by tracking the status in the app.
		<br><br>
		We offer different reimbursement methods for your convenience:
		<br><br>
		<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 2em;">
			<li>ACH Transfer</li>
			<li>PayPal* (Please note: PayPal may charge their own processing fees to receive funds)</li>
			<li>Check* (Please note: A processing fee of $12.99 applies)</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		Please select your preferred reimbursement method within 30 days from the date of approval to ensure a smooth process. Failure to do so may result in the closure of your one-time claim. We kindly request that you submit your receipt in a timely manner to avoid any inconvenience.
